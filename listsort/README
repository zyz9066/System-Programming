THIS PROBLEM IS TO READ A LIST OF WORDS FROM stdin AND THEN SORT THEM

This version provides you with a linked list
each node consists of a "next" pointer, followed by "value", the characters of a word.
The last node has next=NULL. node space is allocated on the heap, size varies.

You must edit the Makefile, so it works, I have just started it. 

in stringutils.c, 
	YOU must decide how to print the list
	readlist has been tested, it reads words from stdin,
	  you must type CTRL-D for Done (EOF)
	  OR get input from a file, this way:
	      ./sort <quick.txt
	There is also a longer <paradise.txt

	freespace would free the heap space that readlist allocated,
	  after that, no point in calling printlist. 
	  This would be needed in the context of a larger piece of software. 
	  But I didn't do it, would be similar to print. You don't have to either

in sort.c
	You need to actually sort the list so the words
	are arranged in dictionary order, using strcmp.
	Use any sorting method you like. 
	Mergesort would be well suited to use with linked lists, 
	and length would be useful in finding the middle.

swap.s	is useful to swap any 2 pointer values (note that I modified it
	to swap 8-bit pointers.)

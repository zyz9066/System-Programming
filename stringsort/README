THIS PROBLEM IS TO READ A LIST OF WORDS FROM stdin AND THEN SORT THEM

You must edit the Makefile, so it works, I have just started it. 

in stringutils.c, 
	YOU must decide how to print the list
	readarray has been tested, it reads words from stdin,
	  you must typoe CTRL-D for Done (EOF)
	  OR get input from a file, this way:
	      ./sort <quick.txt
	There is also a longer <paradise.txt

	freespace free's the heap space that readarray allocated,
	  after that, no point in calling printarray, so you could
	  remove that last call in sortmain, once you have seen it "work"

in sort.c
	You need to actually sort (the pointers) so the words
	are arranged in dictionary order, using strcmp.
	Use any sorting method you like.

swap.s	is useful to swap any 2 pointer values (note that I modified it
	to swap 8-bit pointers.)
